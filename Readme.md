## Requirements

All requirements are documented in the `cargo.toml` and `pyproject.toml` files.
Building the project requires **both** the Rust compiler and the Python interpreter.

At time of writing, we used the following versions:

- Rust 1.84.0
- Python 3.12.8 (Initially 3.11)

## Installation

To install the project, clone the repository, open a terminal in the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```

We highly recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

## Usage

We provide a set of CLI commands to interact with the main functionalities of the project.
Each command will start with `evd` followed by the subcommand.
Note that subcommands can have their own subcommands.

To see the list of available commands, run:

```bash
evd --help
```

This will also work for subcommands:

```bash
evd subcommand --help
```

We include `trogon` integration to run the commands in a TUI environment.

```bash
evd tui
```

Note that `trogon` is a fairly experimental library and may not work as expected.
