"""
Python bindings for the `evdplanner` Rust library.

It includes classes that represent various geometric and rendering constructs, such as
vectors (`Vec3`), rays (`Ray`), intersections (`Intersection`), renderers (`Renderer`), and
meshes (`Mesh`).

Each class in this package corresponds to a struct in the Rust library, and the methods of
these classes correspond to the methods of the Rust structs. The classes in this package can be
used to interact with the Rust library in a Pythonic way.

This package is part of a larger project that uses both Rust and Python. The Rust part of the
project is responsible for the heavy lifting, while the Python part provides a user-friendly
interface.
